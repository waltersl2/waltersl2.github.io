  <p> At the age of 36, my family doctor came to the realization that I am Autistic and referred me to the Adult Autism Diagnostic Clinic at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Edmonton, AB (I am still waiting to be assessed). </p>
  <p> Through many hours of research, I have come to learn that there is no one way to define autism. Each and every autistic person experiences being on the spectrum in their own beautiful and challenging way.</p>
  <p> For myself, it has felt like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I now understand that I am not broken or damaged, my brain is just wired differently, and I experience life from a heightened sensory perspective.</p>
