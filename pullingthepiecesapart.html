      <h3><b>Pulling the Pieces Apart</b></h3>
      <h5><em>My Journey into Autism, <span class="w3-opacity">October 22, 2020</span></em></h5>
      <p> In July 2019, at the age of 36, my family doctor and I realized that I am Autistic, after many years of trying to figure out the root of my challenges. She referred me to the Adult Autism Diagnostic Clinic at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Edmonton, AB, and I am still waiting to be assessed (I was told it is a two-year waitlist).</p>
      <p> Through many hours of research, I have learned that there is no one way to define autism from a personal perspective (which expands beyond the medical community’s neurodevelopmental definition). Every autistic person experiences being on the spectrum in their own beautiful and challenging way. As I have come to understand, I am on the higher functioning end of the spectrum. Some still refer to it as Asperger’s Syndrome, while more recently, others refer to it as Level 1 Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>
      <p> Discovering that I am autistic has lifted a weight off my shoulders. I no longer view myself as broken or damaged, my brain is just wired differently, and I experience life from a heightened sensory perspective. As beautiful and wondrous as the world is, sometimes my senses cannot handle it, and I must take refuge in a quiet place. Slowing down and finding refuge in such a place allows me to find gratitude in what I have experienced because even though it may overwhelm me, I can still explore the world in my authentic way.</p>
      <p> I see the world in pictures formed from tiny little images (like puzzle pieces). In my mind, I pull the pieces apart to figure things out, and once I have done so, I put them back together to create a whole new picture that represents my understanding. My pictures may not look like how anyone else sees the world, but they are still beautiful and equally valid.</p>
