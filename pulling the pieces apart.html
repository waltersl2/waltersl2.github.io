      <h5>My Journey into Autism, <span class="w3-opacity">October 22, 2020</span></h5>
    </div>
<p> At the age of 36, my family doctor came to the realization that I am Autistic and referred me to the Adult Autism Diagnostic Clinic at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Edmonton, AB (I am still waiting to be assessed). </p>
<p> Through many hours of research, I have come to learn that there is no one way to define autism. Each and every autistic person experiences the being on the spectrum in their own beautiful and challenging way.</p>
<p> For myself, it has felt like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I now understand that I am not broken or damaged, my brain is just wired differently, and I experience life from a heightened sensory perspective.</p>
