  <p> <strong>Welcome to my Autistic Life</strong> </p>
  <img src="me1.jpg" alt="ME" />
  <p class="plain"> It has been quite a journey to get to this point, after a lifetime of misunderstanding why I am the way I am. </p>
  <p class="fancy"> At the age of 36, my family doctor came to the realization that I am Autistic and referred me to the Adult Autism Diagnostic Clinic at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Edmonton, AB (I am still waiting to be assessed). </p>
